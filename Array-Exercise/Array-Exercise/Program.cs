// Here your Exercise will go in
// The goal are:
// to create an array where the user can store 5+ integers
// - ask the user to enter the amount of integers into the array
// - sort the integers from lowest-highest numbers first independent on how the users entered the numbers
// - print them out to the console
// - then reverse the array and also print it out (just for practice)
// - after the array is sorted, give the user an opportunity to search for their inputs
// - then print their searched inputs + position their at
